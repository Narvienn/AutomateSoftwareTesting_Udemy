# Step 1: install virtualenv (if not already installed)
# Step 2: navigate to your selected folder and run: virtualenv venv --python=python3.6 (or higher)
# (This is to separate the new virtualenv from any previous instances of it, and to avoid messing up library dependencies
# e.g. if your old virtualenv uses older library versions that your previous projects rely on)

# Step 3: run mkdir blog, then ls
# blog becomes project folder and venv - the interpreter folder


# Step 4: Under blog folder in your Python editor, create a tests folder
# Step 5: Create Python files: app.py, blog.py, and post.py
